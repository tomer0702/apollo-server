What is graphQL?
  GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.                                

  Difference between GraphQL and Rest?
  REST and GraphQL are two ways to send data over HTTP. The REST-based approach is the traditional way of doing so and has gained a very high adoption rate in many application stacks in the last years. A REST API is an architectural concept for network-based software. GraphQL, on the other hand, is a query language, a specification, and a set of tools that operates over a single endpoint using HTTP .

  Write down about Schema and Resolvers.
    Resolvers are per field functions that are given a parent object, arguments, and the execution context, and are responsible for returning a result for that field. Resolvers cannot be included in the GraphQL schema language, so they must be added separately. The collection of resolvers is called the "resolver map".
    
      The GraphQL specification includes a human-readable schema definition language (or SDL) that you use to define your schema and store it as a string. This is a short example of schema,
       type Book {
           title: String
           author: Author
           }
        type Author {
               name: String
               books: [Book]
               }
